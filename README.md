# cmake_playground

**NOTE**: https://github.com/dkorolev/cmake_playground_with_current is a bit more up to date.

The goal of this project is provide the reference code to:

- [x] Use `cmake`.
- [x] Ensure the auto [re-]{configure/build} only does what has to be done.
- [x] Have the project integrate with `googletest`.
- [x] Have the project integrate with `ctest`.
- [x] Have it work on Linux, from the command line.
- [x] Have it work on Linux from Qt Creator.
- [x] Have it work on Windows, under Visual Studio 2019.
- [x] Have the newly added tests autodiscovered.
- [ ] Have it run its "test" on some public CI/CD.
- [x] Do all of the above in such that the very code directory is not polluted by `cmake` artifacts and build results.
- [x] A target for `clang-format`.
