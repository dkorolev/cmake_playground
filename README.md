# cmake_playground

The goal of this project is provide the reference code to:

- [ ] Use `cmake`.
- [ ] Ensure the auto [re-]{configure/build} only does what has to be done.
- [ ] Have the project integrate with `googletest`.
- [ ] Have the project integrate with `ctest`.
- [ ] Have it work on Linux, from the command line.
- [ ] Have it work on Linux from Qt Creator.
- [ ] Have it work on Windows, under Visual Studio 2017/2019.
- [ ] Have the newly added tests autodiscovered.
- [ ] Have it run its "test" on some public CI/CD.
- [ ] Do all of the above in such that the very code directory is not polluted by `cmake` artifacts and build results.
